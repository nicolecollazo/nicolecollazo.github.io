	<p> I am a 20 year old Journalism + Design major at The New School, originally from Caguas, Puerto Rico. I love writing, drinking coffee, and reading art books (or anything else art related.) I am currently a Contributing Latina Writer for PopSugar. Some of my works have been also published on the New School Free Press and HoneySuckle Magazine.
