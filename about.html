<body>
<p> Growing up in Puerto Rico, my mom would always take me to museums and started me out in different art classes like painting, music, and dance. I stuck primarily to ballet but I always found in my free time a passion for reading, which would then inspire me to write. Even when I was a kid and didn’t know how to hold a pen, I would narrate stories to my mom and make her write them. In high school, I was oriented more to math and sciences yet I found a way to implement these artistic passions of mine in everything I did. Attending a liberal arts college in New York City, Eugene Lang College at The New School, I am currently in my third year in the Journalism + Design department. Here I have developed skills such as:
		<ul>
			<li> Research </li>
			<li> Interviewing </li>
			<li> Developing digital and print content </li>
			<li> Organization within short and strict deadlines </li>
			<li> among many other things. </li> </p>
		</ul>
<p>
	In my time as a student, I have written for the university’s newspaper as well as other publications. Take a look at my published works <a href= works.html> here.</a>
	<p> Now, these are some random facts about me: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream is my absolute favorite. </li>
			<li> Spanish is my first language. </li>
			<li> I lived in Puerto Rico until I was 17. </li>
			<li> I’m a Virgo. </li>
			<li> I love making lists (probably because I’m a Virgo.) </li>

	</ul>
