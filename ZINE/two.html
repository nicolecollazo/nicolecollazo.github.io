    <p> Dear family of mine: I sometimes wish you all were more open minded and less judgemental toward the changing times of our generation. There’s not only one sexuality or two genders. And I wish I could be openly curious and experimental without being told “It’s just a phase, you’ll get over it.” I wish I could freely dress in “masculine” or “feminine” outfits without having my sexuality assumed or questioned. I wish I could explore myself as I explore the world.
With no strings attached.
Just pure exploration.
But for now I’ll keep this curiosity to myself. <p>

  <p> Dear Megan: I have to tell you something. I’ve been thinking about it for a month but it wasn’t until Halloween that I did something about it. I started developing a sort of crush on your first love. At first, I felt super guilty so I kept my distance from you and secretly longed to talk to him.
On Halloween, I had one too many drinks and I texted him, telling him how I felt attracted to him yet I felt guilty... specially since he has already slept with one of your friends.
The next day, I told him to forget about it and he kindly accepted my request (I wish I gave him a chance to talk about how he felt). Now, I know I don’t owe you anything and who I like isn’t any of your business. And if anything happens between him and I during winter break, know that I’m not sorry.</p>

<p> Dear classmates: When we were together in school I was tough with some of you. I would not share my things with you. I would not spend time or play with everybody. Always decided and direct over the group. Some of you maybe felt bad about my decisions but never told me anything. Most of you continue to be my friends today. Others decided not to spend time with me as adults or I didn’t want to be friends with them now. Not everybody has to like others. But now I know that there are other and better ways of leadership and strength.</p>

<p> Dear you:
The story of how we met is just as basic as every other modern age “love” story.
You slid in my DMs, I said thank you and we thought it had ended there. However, what we didn’t know was that there would be over a hundred nights of staying up, talking about how we felt about the world and
who we aspired to be. What I didn’t know was that you’d be such an essential being in my life. That’s not a secret to you, but what is a secret is how I still have feelings for you. My mom doesn’t know it, my best friend doesn’t know it, and for some time, I convinced myself that I didn’t know it.No matter how much I try to find things to hate about you or things to push me away, the voice in my head tells me otherwise.
After the day we physically met for the first time and it all happened so organically, I was convinced you were my soulmate. I gave you my favorite book, just so you always had a piece of me. I don’t think you’ve read it, which is fine, but I hope you keep it so you don’t forget about me completely. One day, I hope I can tell you everything I’ve listed above but for now, the secret is safe with me.</p>
<br> </br>
