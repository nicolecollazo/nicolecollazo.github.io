    <p> I usually don’t tell people this but a lot of my friends left the city this year and it hurt a lot. I thought that my supposed friend who is also dealing with these goodbyes would confide in me. Instead, she claims that she feels abandoned and that she has no one. I distanced myself from her because I was tired of her treating me like she’s been left with the scraps.
To be honest, I’ve been much happier no longer trying to chase someone that doesn’t deserve to be chased. <p>

  <p> I usually don’t tell people this but every time I clean my room I try to do it while naked. I always clean naked. It’s kind of fun and I end up trying on all the clothes I couldn’t find before that I did while rearranging my whole room. I later end up laying on the floor tired out of my mind but I guess I like getting things done in the nude. </p>

  <p> I usually don’t tell people this but you meant a lot to me for many reasons. You still do. We would be amazing together but you are not ready. I am not waiting for you but I do want you. I see a future with you. You have caused so much doubt & distress in me but I get it. We’re human. Indecisive & unsure. One day, maybe one day we’ll be together. Until then, you live your life & I’ll live mine. </p>

	<p> I usually don’t tell people this but when I was just five weeks old I broke my foot and had to get stitches that were basically as long as my foot. Now that I’ve grown up it’s so tiny compared to my height but I still think about it almost everyday. It’s kind of unusual.</p>

	<p> I usually don’t tell people this but it’s November and chilly and I’ve realized everything that has happened these past few years is okay. It’s incredible how much you’ve helped me grow and learn to love and appreciate life in all it is. Make of this what you will, R. xx </p>
