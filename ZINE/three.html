    <p> One of my biggest secrets is that my ex-boyfriend cheated on me throughout our entire relationship with his ex-girlfriend. She stalked my Instagram for 5 months before him and I were exclusive and would message me asking if him and I were together or telling me to block her. I chose to ignore my intuition and give him my trust. The day before our one year anniversary he told me he had been cheating on me with
his ex girlfriend the entire time him and I were together. I stayed with him after he admitted this to me and he continued to cheat on me with her and a few other women, but my fixation was on his ex girlfriend. I compared myself to her everyday for almost a year and a half and I still do. <p>

  <p> I love my brother and my mom. They’re my family, but when they’re together, I hate it. They can’t have a normal conversation for more than 5 minutes. They fight 24/7 and I hate that I can’t be with both of them at the same time. </p>
