		<p> <h1> <a href= zine.html> UNCOVERING </a> </h1></p>
		<p> <h2> stories with art + women of color </h2> </p>
<div class="container">
		<p> Art can be used as a vivid representation of emotions and experiences with words or visual images. This zine uses both. </p>
		<p> Sometimes we just need to get stuff off our chest and we are silenced, in serious environments as much as playful ones, specially women of color. Here, we are given the opportunity to let out any anecdote they have always wanted to share but have kept as a secret. There are a variety of anonymous stories, allowing the participants to voice out any experience they need to need to. </p>
		<p> Women of color from the U.S. and the Caribbean ages 16 to 46 shared stories for this project. At the end of the zine, you have the opportunity to uncover your own story. </p>
