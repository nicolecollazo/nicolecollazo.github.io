    <p> When I was younger, I had this constant irrational fear that someone would take me while I was asleep. This fear kept me from ever going to bed peacefully. Instead my mom would have to crawl into bed with me, sing to me, or play my favorite Disney Princesses CD on my blue CD player. Still, nothing was able to ease my anxieties.So, I came up with a plan: if anyone were to climb in through my window with plans of taking me away, I would lie very still. The comforter would camouflage my body just enough to where only my head was visible. The kidnapper would see that I was only a head, and decide not to take me because what was he going to do with just a head? <p>

  <p> When I graduated high school, I wanted to take a gap year and do a volunteering program somewhere far from home, but my parents forced me to go to school for something I was sure I didn’t want to study. So I went to my first two days of class and then dropped out and got a job until the end of that school year. No one knows except for two friends. It’s going to be an interesting story to tell my parents eventually. </p>

  <p> When I graduated high school, my classmates and I went on a trip to the Dominican Republic. On our 4th night at the hotel, around 2:45 am, a classmate knock in our room door. He was tipsy so we allowed him to stay with us since we trusted him.
One of our roommates was sick and slept at her parents hotel room that night, so there was space and nobody felt threatened in any way. My classmate got into bed next to me. I went back to sleep. Everything was fine until I felt a hand down my pj pants and underwear. Our sweet, introverted classmate was touching my private parts.
An unwelcomed and totally uncalled action.
I woke up and kicked him so hard he fell out of the bed, it was an automatic response. Everyone in the room woke up because of the ruckus and asked what happened. I said “Nothing! He fell
and he is leaving!” He didn’t try to justify or defend himself... he just left. I was ashamed of what happened. It was a big surprise and sad feeling. I wanted to avoid confrontation, a big fight. I decided not to ever speak about that incident. I don’t think I ever told my daughter about this.</p>

  <p> When I first traveled to NYC it was kind of a big deal. It was to visit my dad who I hadn’t seen in a year. I think I was about twelve years old. I remember landing and thinking in my head that our reunion would be like in movies where two people who’ve missed each other hug for a while while the rest of the world stops. Mind you, my parents had recently gotten divorced so not living with him and not seeing him as often was still new to me, so needless to say I missed him very much. When I got off the plane I looked for him in the crowd and when I saw him I sort of jogged with excitement to go hug him, but I was met with a side-hug. I know my dad doesn’t show his affection with physical interactions but it still hurt. I was embarrassed and hurt.</p>
